	<p>Welcome to my deposit of drawings and other things of mine.</p>
  <h1>Drawings</h1>
     <h2>Two Gooey Friends</h2>
	<p>February 09, 2023</p>
     <img src="https://cifronium.github.io/drawings/twogooeyfriends.png">
	<p>This is a drawing I made to showcase the pair of simple characters in it.</p>		
     <h2>Snowspouses</h2>
	<p>January 02, 2023</p>
     <img src="https://cifronium.github.io/drawings/snowspouses.png">
	<p>A slightly weird idea I had since a few weeks ago, there isn't much to say about it other than the fact it solely uses shades and tints of the same turquoise and red.</p>	
     <h2>Poc Duck</h2>
	<p>December 12, 2022</p>
     <img src="https://cifronium.github.io/drawings/pocduck.png">
	<p>This tiny drawing made in MS. Paint is a little tribute to a duck species, in my country, that has been extinct since 1989.</p>
     <h2>Cockroach on the Sink</h2>
	<p>December 05, 2022</p>
     <img src="https://cifronium.github.io/drawings/cockroachonthesink.png">
	<p><strong>Oldest thing you will find here, posted the same day this site was set up, minutes after that.</strong></p>
	<p>This is a tiny drawing I made in MS. Paint, I was inspired from seeing cockroaches pass by the bathroom sink.</p>
